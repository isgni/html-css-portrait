    "About You"
    
    I know a place
    It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
    We get married in our heads
    Something to do whilst we try to recall how we met
    
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten about you?
    
    You and I
    Were alive
    With nothing to do I could lay and just look in your eyes
    Wait and pretend
    Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end
    
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten about you?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten about you?
    
    There was something about you that now I can't remember
    It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
    And I'll miss you on a train
    I'll miss you in the morning
    I never know what to think about, so think about you
    (I think about you)
    About you
    Do you think I have forgotten about you?
    About you
    About you
    Do you think I have forgotten about you?
